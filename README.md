# Advent of Code solutions
## 2022
Each day's solution lives in its own file in `src/bin/dayXX.rs`.

Solutions read from `stdin` by default. They also include tests, which use `data/dayXX_{example,input}.txt`.

For example, to run the Day 1 solution with `input.txt`:
```
cargo run --bin day01 < input.txt
```
